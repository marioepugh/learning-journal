My learning journal for Code 201 August 4, 2017</br>
"# LJ Code 201 - Day 19"

This is my last learning journal of Code 201. Later today is the final presentation, this week has been rewarding and challenging. To see a vision turn into a final product was amazing. I couldn't have asked to be placed with a better group of individuals.</br>
This course has taught me so much, I've enjoyed it tremendously.</br>
Now I must work on my presentation and what I am going to say.
