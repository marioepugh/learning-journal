My learning journal for Code 201 in July 2017
"# LJ Code 201 - Day 2"

Well, software development is a challenge. It's even more mind altering
or mind blowing than I thought. This is something I have wanted to do
for a while so I hope it starts to click and I can work quicker than I
am. I am extremely happy for all of the assistance when I am stumped which
feels like every few minutes.
- I hope by the end of the week I am more confident.
- Instead of journaling all of the doom and gloom I may feel towards
this course on the second day kicking my ass I will just say this.
I will become a software developer.

I am becoming more confident with Git remembering the shortcuts I need
to call certain commands which feel good. It lets me know some things
are sticking.

It's now midnight and I will read before bed after I finish listening
to todays call recording on YouTube. I feel it helps me to make sure it
sinks in.


"# LJ Code 201 - 4"

I am learning at least ten new things everyday. This course is amazing and nerve racking at the same time.

I found the pairing exercise very helpful, more eyes on a code definitely help the process and I can see why software development is a team job.

- My tips to myself to help me in this class. Before bed go to the Code Fellows youtube page and rewatch that days class. Also on the weekend I plan on watching the whole week again.
- Next week plan on getting to school early and leaving late. I will get this.
- Make a cheat sheet to help remember short cuts and commands to make life easier.

"# LJ Code 201 - 6"

Week two day one was an extreme challenge for me and I failed. Damn that sucks. Others that left at 7pm were in the same boat so at least I know its not just me. But this class is getting tougher. The things from last week are making sense and now we are onto something a bit different.

- I did not follow the 15 min rule for when getting stuck. So I floundered.
- Make sure to ask for help earlier today if I am stumped.


"# LJ Code 201 - 9"

I had a problem with terminal and was to scared switch to my learning journal directory for fear of messing anything up. I am so not confident yet.
Week two ended with me being behind however I have definitely learned new things.
- Asking for help more often is a good thing.
- This weekend I need to catch up somehow. Hope I can complete my work this weekend. Or I may need to find a weekend tutor. hahhahaah.

"# LJ Code 201 - Day 10”

Simple mistakes are killing me. All weekend I wondered why my photos on my wireframe would not work and today I have another set of eyes look at it and within seconds he sees the photos are missing semi colons. I had to have looked at that page for several hours.
Also on my code I noticed that I misspelled a word and that messed up my pages connecting to each other.
- I definitely know more than I did the first day of class and thats a good thing.
- This GitHub problem I am having is troubling me. I believe I am doing the ACP correctly so I am not sure why I am getting this error each time.

"# LJ Code 201 - Day 11”

I got so much done last night on two overdue assignments and I feel great. I should have turned them in on time to receive full credit but it is hard to do when the assignment isn’t complete. I actually feel like I know more than two weeks ago. It is awesome.
Worked on BusMall yesterday which was a challenge. Didn’t get it fully working yesterday but will today.
-I am writing this journal on the bus, I am sure if this was an idea for people they would enjoy it judging by the long faces I am seeing this morning.
-My goat for Tuesday is to get everything turned in and get my work current before end of day.
