My learning journal for Code 201 in July 2017
"# LJ Code 201 - Day 2"

Well, software development is a challenge. It's even more mind altering
or mind blowing than I thought. This is something I have wanted to do
for a while so I hope it starts to click and I can work quicker than I
am. I am extremely happy for all of the assistance when I am stumped which
feels like every few minutes.
- I hope by the end of the week I am more confident.
- Instead of journaling all of the doom and gloom I may feel towards
this course on the second day kicking my ass I will just say this.
I will become a software developer.

I am becoming more confident with Git remembering the shortcuts I need
to call certain commands which feel good. It lets me know some things
are sticking.

It's now midnight and I will read before bed after I finish listening
to todays call recording on YouTube. I feel it helps me to make sure it
sinks in.


"# LJ Code 201 - 4"

I am learning at least ten new things everyday. This course is amazing and nerve racking at the same time.

I found the pairing exercise very helpful, more eyes on a code definitely help the process and I can see why software development is a team job.

- My tips to myself to help me in this class. Before bed go to the Code Fellows youtube page and rewatch that days class. Also on the weekend I plan on watching the whole week again.
- Next week plan on getting to school early and leaving late. I will get this.
- Make a cheat sheet to help remember short cuts and commands to make life easier.
