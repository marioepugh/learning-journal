<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 8”</h1>

Today I worked on the pair programming exercise and it took us a quite a bit of time to get it done because we were not sure if we were doing it correctly. Once we asked for assistance and got on the right track it started coming along. Also I worked on other assignments and wrote up my meetup assignment. </br>

- I need to spend the weekend doing my portfolio assignment and tackling some extra credit.
