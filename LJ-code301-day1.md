<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 1”</h1>


Worked on an exercise with John while pair programming where we both switched off roles of driver and navigator. We worked on a blog exercise where we had to go through existing code and modify it.
I think it was a lot of fun, I am looking forward to doing more of these exercises.</br>
-We added a hamburger, made it bigger, moved it to the right of the page and then made it disappear once the page shrunk below 640px.</br>
-We added all of the nav items in a single row. And to make it better we added a transition color on hover over the items. The page looks really good.
