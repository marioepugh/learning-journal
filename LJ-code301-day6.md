<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 6”</h1>
Today I worked on a pair programming exercise and we figured out the initial to do items fairly quickly and then we worked on the stretch goals. They knocked us for a loop. We went down a rabbit hole and chased how to make it work for a few hours. </br>
Once we figured it how and the site was working correctly we decided to make sure in the future to ACP prior to starting any stretch goals. But overall it was a great experience.</br>
- Shift key and return to tab to the next line while inspecting a page. I wondered all day how to do that.
- Spoke to half of the class regarding the Tuesday Operation Code meetup, should be a great class turn out. Most of them didn't realize we had to collect info on two people like their names, what they do and where they work. Seeing their faces was the best, welcome to networking.
