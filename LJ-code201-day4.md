My learning journal for Code 201 in July 2017
"# LJ Code 201 - 4"

I am learning at least ten new things everyday. This course is amazing and nerve racking at the same time.

I found the pairing exercise very helpful, more eyes on a code definitely help the process and I can see why software development is a team job.

- My tips to myself to help me in this class. Before bed go to the Code Fellows youtube page and rewatch that days class. Also on the weekend I plan on watching the whole week again.
- Next week plan on getting to school early and leaving late. I will get this.
- Make a cheat sheet to help remember short cuts and commands to make life easier.
