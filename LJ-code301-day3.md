<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 3”</h1>


Worked on pair programming with Vitaliy, we switched off roles of driver and navigator on the blog exercise. It was a challenge and we saw it through until the end. It was good working with him and when we were stuck he was good at saying lets go grab help from a TA to keep on track.</br>
Learning so much this week and its only Wednesday night. I am looking forward to doing more of these exercises.</br>
-I really need to work on my portfolio now so I will end this now.
