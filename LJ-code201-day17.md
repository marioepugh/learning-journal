My learning journal for Code 201 August 2, 2017</br>
"# LJ Code 201 - Day 17"

Project week is fun and rewarding. I enjoy working with the group and listening to various ideas. We are using the white board multiple times a day which I think is good for planning and getting use to using the white board.</br>
I see why collaboration is key amongst software developers. It makes the process easier by everyone working on a certain particular section to get  good finished product.</br>
-Today we have planned to get our project to the MVP state so I will finish this journal now and get back to work.
-I am really enjoying this course.
