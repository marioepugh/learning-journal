<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 15”</h1>

Just took the end of week survey, another week done. </br>

Yesterday was difficult when we started out project week, we brainstormed on a project and couldn't come up with anything. We have lots of ideas but none are making any of us want to do it. Hopefully we come up with something we can all get behind and get it done. </br>

I have quizzes and test to take so I will end this now and get some work done and then think about a good project idea.
