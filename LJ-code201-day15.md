My learning journal for Code 201 in July 2017
"# LJ Code 201 - Day 15"

BusMall was challenging and I have things to complete on it this weekend.<br>
Worked on pair programming which was interested to see how different people do things differently.<br>
Its already project week next week. This course went so fast and I was provided with a lot of information to absorb.<br>
- During project week ensure to positive work enviornment.
- Listen to the ideas of others and make sure people aren't talking over one another.
- I am looking forward to seeing how this week turns out.
