<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 5”</h1>

Worked on lab-05 while watching the video which was challenging, I missed something while watching the video so I had a classmate look at my code and he was able to spot it. Always good to have a second set of eyes on things. </br>
- Working in pairs this week was better than working on the lab by myself.
- I enjoy working with existing code and trying to make it work correctly. Doing this while working in a team dynamic is definitely something I enjoy.
- I got a little behind this week but it is early afternoon on Sunday and I have some time to catch up on things now and thats what I am about to do.
