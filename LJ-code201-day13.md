"# LJ Code 201 - Day 13”

BusMall is challenging, this week has been challenging and it isn’t getting any easier yet. However I know I have learned techniques from the beginning. It will become better overtime.
-Working on making my BusMall print out a list, right now it is duplicating and not printing what I need it to.
-When I fixed some errors on my page myself I felt like something was starting to click.
-I attended the Operation Code Meet up, that was fun and interesting and I see I need to start attending more meet ups if I want to gain more knowledge and meet others in this new community that I am joining.
