<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 13”</h1>

Working on REST and Github API and tokens. Also delved into deploying the blog app through Heroku and the use of tokens to display that information securely.</br>
I have found that doing the bonus assignments have helped me to understand the topics more.</br>
Discussed project week ideas with several classmates and we came up with other ideas that were not discussed during the class project week open discussion. Should be a fun week no matter what team I am placed on. Looking forward to it.
