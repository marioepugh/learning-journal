My learning journal for Code 201 in July 2017
"# LJ Code 201 - 6"

Week two day one was an extreme challenge for me and I failed. Damn that sucks. Others that left at 7pm were in the same boat so at least I know its not just me. But this class is getting tougher. The things from last week are making sense and now we are onto something a bit different.

- I did not follow the 15 min rule for when getting stuck. So I floundered.
- Make sure to ask for help earlier today if I am stumped.
