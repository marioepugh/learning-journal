<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 11”</h1>

Beginning week 3, paired programmed by adding routes to our href on the navigation elements and then we added the script files. Configured javascript files for the home and about links and called it. Created a function and invoked it. </br>

Over the weekend I worked on past assignments that needed to be reworked and did some work on my portfolio assignment </br>

Right now I am at Avvo for the Seattle JS Hackers meetup with Ron, Adrienne, Vitaliy and Kevin. It is so much better to go to meet ups with a group. The last meet up I went to was a presentation style and this one is a programming night. It is interesting to see the difference.
