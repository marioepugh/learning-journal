My learning journal for Code 201 in July 2017
"# LJ Code 201 - 9"

I had a problem with terminal and was to scared switch to my learning journal directory for fear of messing anything up. I am so not confident yet.
Week two ended with me being behind however I have definitely learned new things.
- Asking for help more often is a good thing.
- This weekend I need to catch up somehow. Hope I can complete my work this weekend. Or I may need to find a weekend tutor. hahhahaah.
