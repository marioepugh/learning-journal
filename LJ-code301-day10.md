My learning journal for Code 301 August 25 2017

<h1>"# LJ Code 301 - Day 10”</h1>

Just took the end of week survey, that means I made it through another week, so happy. </br>

I pair programmed yesterday and today, each day the exercise was more challenging, yet minimizing the code you need to write. It is pretty incredible. I am learning so much I just hope I can retain it.</br>

Completed the SQL bonus assignment definitely helped understands labs 8 and 9. This weekend after I have finished my other assignments and redo's I plan on completing a few more of them.  I think they would help and aid in learning.

- Portfolio assignment catch up time this weekend, so happy. My grade is suffering due to being behind on it.
