"# LJ Code 201 - Day 10”

Simple mistakes are killing me. All weekend I wondered why my photos on my wireframe would not work and today I have another set of eyes look at it and within seconds he sees the photos are missing semi colons. I had to have looked at that page for several hours.
Also on my code I noticed that I misspelled a word and that messed up my pages connecting to each other.

- I definitely know more than I did the first day of class and thats a good thing.
- This GitHub problem I am having is troubling me. I believe I am doing the ACP correctly so I am not sure why I am getting this error each time.
